# Evolutionary.Net

Evolutionary.Net is a machine learning framework that allows you to easily write genetic programs using .NET.  Genetic programs are a form of evolutionary computing, where the computer evolves a solution to a problem using principles from natural selection.

## Genetic Programming Basics

The ideas behind genetic programming originally came from a book called “Genetic Programming” by John Koza.  It described how populations of automatically generated programs could compete against each other, with the fittest programs selected for reproduction via genetic crossover.  Ultimately, after a number of generations, the best solution found is executable code that can be used like any other function.

### What Are Genetic Programs Good For?
Due to the nature of a genetic program evolving, they are often well-suited for problems where there are many possible solutions.  In other words, if the solution space is very large, possibly due to combinatorial factors, a genetic program may be the best way to find a solution.
 
Often genetic programs are used when a solution is not immediately obvious to a human computer programmer.  One classic use case is finding a mathematical function or equation that fits a set of data.  By supplying a genetic engine a set of variables, constants, and math functions (like add, subtract, multiply, etc.), the end result will be code that fits the data closely, which is useful for predictions and trend detection.
### How Do Genetic Programs Work?
To create a genetic program, you supply the engine with the components (called the *primitive set*) that might be needed to solve a problem.  Then the engine creates an initial randomly generated population of candidate solutions.  
 
A candidate solution is a tree data structure, with each node in the tree being either a constant (usually numeric, but it could be Boolean), a variable name (which is how the generated program implements parameters), or a function node.  Constant and variable nodes are known as terminal nodes since they don&#39;t have children, but functions usually do have children - one per parameter.  For example, a node for **add** would have two child nodes, and once each of those children are evaluated, the **add** node adds the values together and returns the sum total.
 
Evaluating a tree is done recursively.  First, the root node of the tree is evaluated, and if it&#39;s a function node (which it should be), then each of its children nodes is evaluated, and then the function operation (whatever it happens to be) is executed.  Because of this approach, the tree can be quite deep and full, with many nodes contributing to a final solution.
 
Each candidate is evaluated and is assigned a numeric fitness score.  You can have lower fitness scores indicate better solutions, but usually the traditional approach is that higher fitness scores indicate better solutions.
 
Then the engine selects candidate solutions two at a time for reproduction, via genetic crossover.  
 
## Getting Started
To get started, download the code and add the assembly to your code.  
 
After that, you need to instantiate an engine object.  When you do that, you must specify the data type for all of the nodes in the expression trees that will be generated.  The concept that all nodes must share a single data type is called* closure*.
 
After instantiating the engine object, you begin by defining the primitive set, which is a collection of constants, variables, functions and terminal functions.
 
Adding constants is easy - you simply pass in the numeric or boolean constants you wish to be available during construction of an expression tree.
 
Adding variables is also easy.  Variables are used to pass information from the calling program into the expression tree, so adding them is as simple as calling AddVariable, passing in the name of the variable.  Then, before the expression tree is evaluated, you must set the value of the variables.
 
Adding a function is quite simple.  You call AddFunction, passing in a lambda function and a name for the function.  In this version of the Evolutionary.NET engine, functions can have up to four parameters each.
 
Terminal functions are a special case of functions - they have zero parameters (meaning, no child nodes).  These functions typically are used to set or get some other information related to the state of the problem, although this information may not be encoded within an expression tree.
 
Once the primitive set is defined, you call the engine and it returns the best solution found.  You can then copy the text representation of that solution into your own code, keeping in mind that you must provide implementations of any functions your expression tree uses.  Since those functions are usually quite simple, these functions are often small and simple.

 
### Installing

Download the code and compile using Visual Studio.  There are no dependencies in the code - it's just straight C#.  Any version of the .NET framework should be fine, although this hasn't been tested with versions prior to 4.5.

### Using Evolutionary.NET
There are two main chunks of code you&apos;ll need to write in order to use Evolutionary.Net.  

First, you instantiate the engine and define the primitive set:
```csharp
			// set up the parameters for the engine
            var engineParams = new EngineParameters()
            {
                CrossoverRate = 0.9F,
                ElitismPercentageOfPopulation = 10,
                IsLowerFitnessBetter = true,
                MutationRate = 0.1F,
                PopulationSize = 1000,
                TourneySize = 3,
                NoChangeGenerationCountForTermination = 10
            };

            // due to closure, all nodes are the same type - float, in this case
            var engine = new Engine<float>(engineParams);

            // we add variables via the name, and then set them in our fitness function (below)
            engine.AddVariable("X");
            
            // reasonable constants, since they combine well with multiplication, addition, etc. 
            engine.AddConstant(0);
            engine.AddConstant(-1);

            // functions 
            engine.AddFunction((a, b) => a + b, "Add");
            engine.AddFunction((a, b) => a - b, "Sub");
            engine.AddFunction((a, b) => a * b, "Mult");
            engine.AddFunction((a, b) => (b == 0) ? 1 : a / b, "Div");

            // the primitive set is defined, so start the process
            engine.AddFitnessFunction((t) => EvaluateCandidate(t));
            
            // retrieve the best solution found and display
            var bestSolution = engine.FindBestSolution();
            Console.WriteLine("Best result is:");
            Console.WriteLine(bestSolution.ToString());
```

Second, the thing that drives the evolutionary process is the fitness function.  Here's an example:

```csharp
        private static float EvaluateCandidate(CandidateSolution<float> candidate)
        {
            // run through our training data and see how close it is to the answers from the genetic program
            float totalDifference = 0;
            foreach (var dataPoint in testDataPoints)
            {
            	// specify the value of our variable before evaluating this candidate
                candidate.SetVariableValue("X", dataPoint.X);
                float result = candidate.Evaluate();

                // now figure the difference between the calculated value and the training data
                float diff = Math.Abs(result - dataPoint.Y);
                totalDifference += diff;
            }

            // since the genetic engine doesn't stop while fitness scores are still improving,
            // speed things up by truncating the precision to 4 digits after the decimal
            totalDifference = (float)(Math.Truncate(totalDifference * 10000F) / 10000F);
            return totalDifference;
        }

```
