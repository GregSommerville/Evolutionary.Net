TO DO
==========================

- Crossover:
	- when copying terminal functions over, be sure to point them at the new candidate's state data
		- Need new recursive method called SetStateDataReference() (can't do it via a property, because that wouldn't recurse)

- Multithreading:  
	Always on, but allow them to specify #threads
	variable data must be at the candidate level

- Autodefined functions:
	.AddAutoDefinedFunction(numParams)

- engine.LoadSolution(solutionName, expressionString) : deserializes, opposite of solution.ToString()

- WPF app to display any function in a tree form
