TO DO
==========================

--------------------------
Blackjack Example
--------------------------
- OverallStrategy class:
	- This class should implement the display function, given a canvas to draw on
	- Redo EvaluateCandidate so it loads a BJStrategy object, and then we run it using a BJStrategyEvaluator
= Class BJStrategyEvaluator, which is given 1+ strategies and tests them by running and returning data about performance

- Solution.LoadFromFile() .SaveToFile(), .LoadFromString()
- Increase height of display (or make dynamic)
- UI for #nochange, min/max tree depth, min/max generations, selection style

- Engine.AddAutoDefinedFunction(numParams)


--------------------------
Engine
--------------------------
- EngineParameters.SingleCrossoverAllowed: def = true (50/50 split)
	50% of the time, crossover should take a random subtree from the better candidate and insert into weaker, but not vice-versa

- When randomly constructing, should the node type be selected by category?  
	So if you have 2 functions but 18 terminals, is that 50/50, or 1/9?

- .AddDeferredFunction - calls
	<T> functionName (List<Node<T,S> parameterNodes, S state) - good for boolean shortcircuiting

- WPF app to load and display any expression tree
