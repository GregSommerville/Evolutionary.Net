TO DO
==========================

--------------------------
Blackjack Example
--------------------------
- Implement a solution per holding (34)
- Implement a solution per holding/upcard combo
- Each solution should run a set of tests on the final result, and report on performance numbers
- Write resulting times to text file for comparisons

- for looping while constructing strategy from candidate, use rank enums when possible
- Solution.LoadFromFile() .SaveToFile(), .LoadFromString()
- Increase height of display (or make dynamic)

- Engine.AddAutoDefinedFunction(numParams)


--------------------------
Engine
--------------------------
- EngineParameters.SingleCrossoverAllowed: def = true (50/50 split)
	50% of the time, crossover should take a random subtree from the better candidate and insert into weaker, but not vice-versa

- When randomly constructing, should the node type be selected by category?  
	So if you have 2 functions but 18 terminals, is that 50/50, or 1/9?

- .AddDeferredFunction - calls
	<T> functionName (List<Node<T,S> parameterNodes, S state) - good for boolean shortcircuiting

- WPF app to load and display any expression tree
