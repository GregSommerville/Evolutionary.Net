TO DO
==========================

- Variable nodes should just store a reference to candidate, and use that to get variables

- Multithreading:  
	Always on, but allow them to specify #threads
	variable data must be at the candidate level

- Autodefined functions:
	.AddAutoDefinedFunction(numParams)

- engine.LoadSolution(solutionName, expressionString) : deserializes, opposite of solution.ToString()

- WPF app to display any function in a tree form
